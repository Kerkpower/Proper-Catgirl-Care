Your new cat-girl has specific dietary needs. A proper diet will keep her fit, active, and healthy for many years. On the other hand, a bad diet can make her overweight and lazy and cause serious health problems.

Your cat-girl is bred to be compatible with most human food, but you need to be careful and avoid certain types of food, except for occasional treats.

A good diet should consist of a large amount of daily protein to keep her happy and active. We suggest feeding her: 50% low-fat meats like chicken, fish, and beef. You can serve them raw or cooked. It's recommended to cook the majority of her meat to prevent possible intestinal parasites and keep her breath smelling nice. If you want to freshen her breath even more, Kitty-Klean mouthwash is highly recommended.

For the remaining 40%, offer fresh vegetables and fruits. Your cat-girl will likely show interest in fresh greens, so encourage her to eat them. It's adorable to watch her munching on greens, plus it's great for her digestion. If she's not enthusiastic about fruits and veggies, try spraying them with the delicious Krazy-Kat protein spray. That should do the trick!

Limit grains to around 8% of her diet. Cat-girls enjoy occasional grains like rice and barley, but be cautious! Too much can make her feel bloated and uncomfortable.

Keep sugary snacks to 2% or less. Your cat-girl might love them, but they're not good for her! They provide energy and taste great, but they offer no real nutrition. Save sugary snacks for special occasions. And remember, never give alcohol to your cat-girl. It affects them similarly to humans, but even a small amount that would make a person "buzzed" can knock them out. Luckily, most breeds don't like the smell of liquor, so you can use it on objects to discourage their interest.

If your cat-girl starts gaining a belly, first cut back on sweets and try to incorporate more exercise and playtime into her routine. If she's from a less active breed, you can control her weight by reducing meal portion sizes and spreading them throughout the day. It's important to stick to a feeding schedule and avoid snacking. Don't give in to her begging, even though we know it can be tough! It's for her own good! If you choose to have meals with your cat-girl at the table, it's best to provide her with her own bowl. Utensils might not be necessary, but some of the smarter breeds enjoy mimicking their masters and find pleasure in imitating them with utensils. However, if she shows no interest in using utensils, don't force her. Remember, cat-girls can be quite stubborn.
