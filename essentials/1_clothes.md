Your cat-girl will need some basic clothes. You don't have to go all out at first. The shelter or breeder probably had her wear simple t-shirts and pants/shorts. Any brand will work as long as they're made of cotton or natural fibers because cat-girls have sensitive skin. Undergarments are up to you. Once you've handled the new clothes and rubbed them on your face, let your cat-girl smell and mark them by rubbing her cheek against them before attempting to dress her. It's important that she recognizes these clothes as gifts from her master and that they now belong to her. You can buy fancier clothes later if you plan on showing or breeding her, once she's settled into her new home. Ferals and strays will wear whatever clothes they can find, so it's important to get your cat-girl her own clothes following the guidelines mentioned earlier. This will help her bond with you more quickly as her provider and caretaker. When presenting her with new clothes, be careful when undressing a feral/stray. Her old clothes represent her previous unattached life and should be disposed of out of her sight. Shoes are optional and shouldn't be forced. However, if you're going outdoors and the temperature is near freezing, it's still a good idea to have her wear shoes.
