Most cat-girls are initially trained to use litter pans for their bathroom needs. A responsible breeder will usually have them toilet trained by the time they reach sexual maturity, so you only need to show them how to flush and where to find cleaning supplies.

However, if your cat-girl is a stray or feral from a shelter, there's a possibility she was never fully toilet trained. Fortunately, this can be easily addressed in a few ways. When you notice your cat-girl exhibiting signs of needing to eliminate, calmly and carefully pick her up under her arms and place her on the toilet. Hold her gently until she finishes eliminating and then demonstrate proper sanitary wiping. Cat-girls are clean and meticulous creatures, so she will quickly understand how to use the toilet for clean and safe elimination, making both of you happier. 

Unfortunately, some cat-girls have never been toilet trained or spent much time indoors, especially among strays and ferals. Achieving the desired result will require additional time and patience. If your cat-girl refuses to be picked up and moved to the toilet, you'll need to gradually shape her behavior when she shows signs of needing to eliminate. This process may take a few days or even a week or more. Whenever she shows signs of needing to eliminate, quickly and calmly place a Cat-Girlz! Brand floor nappy underneath her. She will quickly associate the nappy with the designated elimination spot. Once again, cat-girls are tidy and clean when it comes to bathroom habits. Now, gradually move the floor nappy closer to the bathroom each time, until it's finally placed in front of the toilet. Eventually, position the nappy over the toilet bowl. She will quickly understand what is expected of her. Make sure to use soothing and calm words during this process, and praise her enthusiastically when she eliminates using the proper method. Cat-girls, even strays and ferals, respond well to positive reinforcement.
